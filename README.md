# HoriSEO

## User Story
In this project we were given a codebase from a website that needs improving. The company would like their webpage to meet accesibility standards so that it is optimized for search engines. Throughout this task, we will also be looking for ways to refactor the code to make it more readable.

## Description 
The first step of the project is to create a repository on Github and pushing the starter code to Github. This is a very important step as it allow me to save my work and also allows others to see my work if ever they need to collaborate with me. The link to that repository is: https://github.com/rfrancesca14/challenge01.git

Here are the steps that i did to refactor the code as required by the "Acceptance Criteria"
 * I gave the website a title called Hori S|E|O (SEO for search engine optimization)
 * Changed all the "div" tags to more descriptive elements such as "nav", "section" and "aside". That way it is easier to read or understand the sections of the codes. 
 * Also changed the tags on CSS file to reflect the changes that I made on index file so that it's properties are still applied. 
 * Fixed the Search Engine Optimization nav by adding an id element so that it now directs the users to the article.
 * Alt attributes are also added to all body images with detailed description of the photos.
 * I renamed the classes for benefits as they all have the same properties this was done to avoid repetition of identical styling properties.
